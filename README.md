This repository contains code for a project that predicts house prices based on three features: area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. It utilizes the SKLearn library for building and training the linear_regression machine learning model.

Project Overview This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load a CSV dataset containing house information (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and price). Handle missing values (if any) through techniques like imputation or removal. Encode categorical features (if present) using techniques like one-hot encoding. Normalize numerical features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms) for better model performance.

Dependencies This project requires the following Python libraries:

Sci-Kit-Learn (for model building and training)

pickle (for storing data and model)

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical computations)
